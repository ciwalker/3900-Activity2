            I am a business analyst in higher education. I have received a Bachelors of Science in 
            Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing from UNO.  After completeing my Degree, 
            I was hired into the Finace Depatrment with a Health Insurance Company.  I learned how to use
            vlookups and pivot tables and that's when my passion went from Marketing to Information
            Technology.  I am excited to be in this class.
