            I am a business analyst in higher education. I have received a Bachelors of Science in 
            Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing from UNO.  After completeing my Degree, 
            I was hired into the Finace Depatrment with a Health Insurance Company.  I learned how to use
            vlookups and pivot tables and that's when my passion went from Marketing to Information
            Technology.  I am excited to be in this class.

            Ed is my kitten.  Well, he is not much of a kitten anymore.  He has kept my sane 
            during the pandemic.  He has transitioned into an indoor/outdoor cat and is now
            able to hunt.  I am torn between proud and mortified.  It's the weirdest feeling.
            on the one hand, knowing he has the skills makes me proud, but I am mortified 
            everytime he brings a bunny or bird in the house.
