# 3900-Activity2

This activity demonstrates basic HTML and CSS skills.

I have created a two-page single site with two images. 
One image is of myself another is of my cat.  Each image
is on a separate page with its own body of text.  The 
second page can be reached via a button on the main page
titiled Page 2.  The website contains content relevant
to the class UNO and lets you get to know me.
