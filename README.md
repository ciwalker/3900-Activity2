# 3900-Activity2

This activity demonstrates basic HTML and CSS skills.

I have created a two-page single site containing
content relevant to the class UNO  and lets you get to know me.  
The main page (index.html) displays an image is of myself 
along with a body of text.  A button on the main page, labeled
"Page 2", contains a link to the second HTML page(Activity2_PG2.html)
The second page contains a second image from the UNO campus and more
body of text about myself, class and UNO.

Each image and a stylesheet(main.css) is included.
